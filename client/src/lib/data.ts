On one axis, 'Impact on Business if Wrong.' On the other, 'Level of Current Evidence.' The assumptions in the 'High Impact / Low Evidence' quadrant are your foundational risks.\n• Design a 'Falsification Experiment' for #1: Isolate the single riskiest assumption.

For example, if users say 'I need this now,' your landing page conversion rate should be high.\n• Assess 'Signal Strength': Not all data is equal. An action (e.g., entering a credit card) is a stronger signal than an opinion (e.g., a positive comment). A pattern across 10 users is stronger than a single data point. Assign a simple 1-3 signal strength score to each piece of evidence.\n• Formulate a 'Reconciliation Hypothesis': Based on the mapped data, create a new, single hypothesis that explains the discrepancy. For example: 'Users say they want the solution, but they are not converting because they don't believe our landing page delivers that solution.'\n• Design the Next Experiment: Your next action must be an experiment designed specifically to test the Reconciliation Hypothesis.

An activated sign-up is a signal. Define the single key action a user must take to experience the core value of your product (the \"aha!\" moment). Your true metric is the percentage of sign-ups that complete this action.\n• Analyze Cohort Retention: Do not look at the cumulative number of sign-ups. Group your sign-ups by the week they joined (a cohort). Measure what percentage of each cohort is still active one week later, two weeks later, etc. If every cohort drops to zero, your sign-ups are meaningless.\n• Qualify with a 'Commitment Question': Follow up every sign-up with a single, automated email asking for a small, non-monetary commitment.

It demonstrates your ability to attract users who actually experience the core value, a prerequisite for ever paying.\n• Proxy for LTV: The 'Commitment Ratio': Measure the percentage of activated users who take a high-intent, non-monetary action that signals future value.

This ratio is a proxy for the \"stickiness\" and embedded value that precedes monetary LTV.\n• The Narrative: Your story to investors is not about current unit economics.

If one channel has significantly better retention, it suggests you are attracting the wrong users elsewhere, not that your product is fundamentally flawed.\n• Analyze the 'First Mile' Funnel: Map out the critical steps a new user must take to reach the \"aha!\" moment. Measure the drop-off rate at each step. A massive drop-off early in the funnel points to an onboarding or usability problem, not a core value proposition problem.\n• Conduct 'Churn Interviews' with Activated Users: Identify users who completed the \"aha!\" moment but still did not return.

This quantifies the breadth of the feature's impact.\n• Impact: On a scale of 0.25 to 3 (0.25=minimal, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=massive), score how much this feature will impact the individual user.

The desire for a \"nicer\" or \"more integrated\" dashboard is a form of procrastination and a misuse of engineering resources.\n• Timebox Any Custom Work: In the rare case that a custom solution is required, it must be treated like any other product feature: it must have a strict scope, a time-boxed budget (e.g., \"no more than one engineer-week\"), and be ruthlessly prioritized against features that deliver value to customers.",

Answer questions, offer insights, and become a trusted voice in the community.
