On one axis, 'Impact on Business if Wrong.' On the other, 'Level of Current Evidence.' The assumptions in the 'High Impact / Low Evidence' quadrant are your foundational risks.\n• Design a 'Falsification Experiment' for #1: Isolate the single riskiest assumption.

For example, if users say 'I need this now,' your landing page conversion rate should be high.\n• Assess 'Signal Strength': Not all data is equal. An action (e.g., entering a credit card) is a stronger signal than an opinion (e.g., a positive comment). A pattern across 10 users is stronger than a single data point. Assign a simple 1-3 signal strength score to each piece of evidence.\n• Formulate a 'Reconciliation Hypothesis': Based on the mapped data, create a new, single hypothesis that explains the discrepancy. For example: 'Users say they want the solution, but they are not converting because they don't believe our landing page delivers that solution.'\n• Design the Next Experiment: Your next action must be an experiment designed specifically to test the Reconciliation Hypothesis.

An activated sign-up is a signal. Define the single key action a user must take to experience the core value of your product (the \"aha!\" moment). Your true metric is the percentage of sign-ups that complete this action.\n• Analyze Cohort Retention: Do not look at the cumulative number of sign-ups. Group your sign-ups by the week they joined (a cohort). Measure what percentage of each cohort is still active one week later, two weeks later, etc. If every cohort drops to zero, your sign-ups are meaningless.\n• Qualify with a 'Commitment Question': Follow up every sign-up with a single, automated email asking for a small, non-monetary commitment.

It demonstrates your ability to attract users who actually experience the core value, a prerequisite for ever paying.\n• Proxy for LTV: The 'Commitment Ratio': Measure the percentage of activated users who take a high-intent, non-monetary action that signals future value.

This ratio is a proxy for the \"stickiness\" and embedded value that precedes monetary LTV.\n• The Narrative: Your story to investors is not about current unit economics.

If one channel has significantly better retention, it suggests you are attracting the wrong users elsewhere, not that your product is fundamentally flawed.\n• Analyze the 'First Mile' Funnel: Map out the critical steps a new user must take to reach the \"aha!\" moment. Measure the drop-off rate at each step. A massive drop-off early in the funnel points to an onboarding or usability problem, not a core value proposition problem.\n• Conduct 'Churn Interviews' with Activated Users: Identify users who completed the \"aha!\" moment but still did not return.

This quantifies the breadth of the feature's impact.\n• Impact: On a scale of 0.25 to 3 (0.25=minimal, 1=low, 2=medium, 3=massive), score how much this feature will impact the individual user.

Your company story is your company strategy.\n\nThe Strategic Narrative Framework:\n• Name a Big, Relevant Change in the World: Start not with your product, but with an undeniable shift that creates high stakes and urgency for your audience (e.g., the rise of the \"subscription economy\").\n• Show There Will Be Winners and Losers: To overcome inertia, you must demonstrate that adapting to this change will create clear winners, while ignoring it will create definite losers. This establishes the consequences of inaction.\n• Tease the \"Promised Land\": Articulate the desirable future state your product helps customers achieve. This is not a description of your product, but a vision of their success.\n• Introduce Features as \"Magic\": Position your product and its features as the specific tools or \"magic gifts\" that help the customer overcome the obstacles that stand between them and the Promised Land.",

Do not use abstract nouns like \"Integrity.\" Instead, define them as observable behaviors. For example, instead of \"Integrity,\" use \"We do what we say we will do.\" This makes them measurable.\n• Architect with the 'Words-Actions-Behaviors' Framework:\n  - Words: Define your communication norms. How will you handle disagreement? How is bad news delivered?\n  - Actions: Define your operational systems. How are decisions made? Who gets hired and promoted? Do these actions align with your stated values?\n  - Behaviors: Define your team rituals. How do you celebrate wins? More importantly, how do you discuss and learn from failures?\n• Operationalize Values in Hiring: Translate each value into specific, rubric-based interview questions.

This number defines the venture's true timeline.\n• Define \"Ramen Profitable\" as the First Milestone: Calculate the absolute minimum monthly revenue needed to cover the founders' basic living expenses and essential business costs. This becomes the company's first, most critical financial goal, as it makes survival the default state.\n• Align on the Fundraising Trigger: Agree on the specific conditions (e.g., \"when we have less than 6 months of combined personal runway remaining\") that will trigger a formal fundraising process. This replaces ambiguity with a clear, pre-agreed plan.\n• Codify in the Founders' Agreement: Document these financial understandings and expectations as part of your formal agreement to ensure they are not forgotten or misinterpreted under pressure.",
