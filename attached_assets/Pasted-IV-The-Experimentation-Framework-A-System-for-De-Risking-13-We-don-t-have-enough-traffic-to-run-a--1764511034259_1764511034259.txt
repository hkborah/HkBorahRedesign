IV.The Experimentation Framework: A System for De-Risking
13. We don't have enough traffic to run a statistically significant A/B test on our landing page. What is a structured framework for running 'low-traffic' experiments that can still provide a strong directional signal on our most critical assumptions about our value proposition?
The ASF Solution:
You are confusing statistical significance with directional evidence. The belief that you need a formal A/B test to learn is an unexamined assumption borrowed from large-scale organizations. At this stage, you are not seeking a 5% conversion lift; you are seeking a 5x signal. You need an architecture for detecting large effects, not for optimizing small ones.
The Sequential Testing Protocol:
    • Test Radically Different Variants (A vs. Z): Do not test small changes like button colors. Test fundamentally different value propositions or headlines. You are looking for a dramatic difference in performance that is obvious even with a small sample size.
    • Measure Over a Longer Duration: Instead of running a test for a few days, run it for a few weeks. This allows you to accumulate more data points and smooth out daily fluctuations, making the underlying trend clearer.
    • Focus on a Single, High-Impact Metric: Do not track multiple metrics. Focus only on the one metric that matters for this experiment (e.g., email sign-up conversion rate). This makes it easier to see a clear winner.
    • Pair with Qualitative Feedback: For users who convert on each variant, trigger a simple one-question survey: "What was it about this page that made you sign up?" This qualitative data provides the "why" behind the numbers and can often be more valuable than the quantitative result itself.
The Principle: In the absence of statistical significance, seek overwhelming directional evidence.
14. Our attempts at experimentation feel chaotic; we launch things, see what happens, and then argue about the results. What is a disciplined, end-to-end 'Experimentation Loop' process that forces us to define a sharp hypothesis, pre-commit to success metrics, and document learnings so that every experiment, pass or fail, yields a concrete asset?
The ASF Solution:
You are not running experiments; you are just "trying stuff." This is not a process problem; it is a failure to apply the scientific method to your business. Without a disciplined architecture for experimentation, your "learnings" are just opinions, and your activity is a waste of your limited runway.
The Disciplined Experimentation Loop:
    • Hypothesize: Before writing any code, state a clear, falsifiable hypothesis in a central document. Use the format: "We believe that [making this change] for [this user segment] will result in [this outcome]. We will know this is true when we see [this quantifiable metric] change."
    • Design & Execute: Build the minimum possible version of the feature or change required to test the hypothesis.
    • Measure & Analyze: Run the experiment for a pre-defined period. At the end, analyze the data and state clearly whether the hypothesis was validated, invalidated, or the result was inconclusive.
    • Document & Share: In the same central document, write a one-paragraph summary of the experiment's outcome and the key learning. This "Institutional Memory" is the most valuable asset you are building at this stage.
    • Review Weekly: Dedicate a portion of your weekly meeting to reviewing the results of completed experiments. This ritual makes learning the core cadence of the company.
The Principle: An experiment that does not yield a durable, documented learning is not an experiment; it is a waste of time.
15. I'm looking at our metrics, and I'm frozen. I can't tell if the data is telling me to pivot or to persevere. What is a decision-making framework that uses a combination of leading and lagging indicators to help us make a non-emotional, evidence-based call on when to kill an idea versus when to iterate?
The ASF Solution:
You are not facing a data problem; you are facing a decision architecture failure. You are looking for a single number to give you a simple answer, but the "pivot or persevere" decision is a complex calculation. You need a framework that forces you to weigh the complete set of evidence, not just one metric on a dashboard.
The Pivot/Persevere Decision Matrix:
    • Assess Leading Indicators (The Signal): On a scale of 1-10, how strong is your qualitative feedback? Are users pulling the product out of you? What is your PMF Survey score? These metrics signal future potential.
    • Assess Lagging Indicators (The Runway): How many months of runway do you have left? What is your current burn rate? These metrics define your timeline and the cost of persevering.
    • Evaluate the Next Testable Hypothesis: On a scale of 1-10, how strong and clear is your next hypothesis? If you persevere, what is the specific, high-impact experiment you will run next week? A weak or fuzzy next step is a strong signal that you are out of ideas on the current path.
    • Make the Call: If you have strong leading indicators and a clear next hypothesis, persevere. If you have weak leading indicators, dwindling runway, and no clear idea what to test next, it is time to pivot. The matrix forces a holistic, non-emotional assessment.
The Principle: Perseverance without a clear next hypothesis is not grit; it is a slow death.
16. How do we build a 'learning velocity' metric as our core KPI? What's a system for measuring and reporting on the speed and quality of our experimentation cycles to ensure our primary focus is on de-risking the business, not just building features?
The ASF Solution:
You are asking how to measure the speed of your engine, not the distance it has traveled. This is the correct architectural question. The unexamined assumption is that progress is measured by outputs (features, revenue). At this stage, progress is measured by the rate at which you convert assumptions into knowledge.
The Learning Velocity Scorecard:
    • Track 'Experiments Shipped per Week': This is your core activity metric. It measures the raw throughput of your build-measure-learn loop. The goal is to consistently increase this number.
    • Measure 'Time-to-Insight': For each experiment, track the number of days from the initial hypothesis to a conclusive result (validated or invalidated). This is your core efficiency metric. Your goal is to relentlessly shorten this cycle time.
    • Monitor 'Hypothesis Pass/Fail Ratio': Track the percentage of your hypotheses that are validated versus invalidated. A ratio that is too high (e.g., 90% pass) is a red flag that you are not taking enough risks or testing bold enough assumptions. A healthy ratio (e.g., 30-50% pass) indicates you are operating at the edge of your knowledge.
    • Review Weekly on a Whiteboard: Like the OMTM, these three metrics should be tracked on a physical whiteboard and reviewed as the first item in your weekly meeting. This makes learning velocity the central, visible, and non-negotiable priority of the company.
The Principle: The most valuable asset a pre-PMF startup is building is not its product, but its institutional knowledge.
